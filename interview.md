# Interview

Ask me the following questions in order to better understand what I want out of my website project. Interview me for a very thorough review of the site to make any adjustments.

- Are all of the images in the public/images folder being used?
- Is there consistency throughout the site?
- What do you want to do know about DevRel?
- Make sure to cover every page and every section.
- Ask if a hero image is needed for individual projects or content
